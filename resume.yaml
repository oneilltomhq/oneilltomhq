projects:
  - name: browser-native-agent
    description: >-
      Chrome extension + LLM agent providing core automation parity with
      Vercel's agent-browser (navigate, snapshot, click, type, screenshot,
      evaluate) but running inside the user's own browser via chrome.debugger —
      no Playwright, no spawned Chromium, inheriting existing auth and extensions.

    highlights:
      - AX tree + DOMSnapshot ref system for LLM element targeting — same [ref=eN] pattern as agent-browser
      - 8 CDP primitives via MV3 service worker with singleton session lifecycle per tab
      - Tool-calling agent loop (Anthropic SDK) — snapshot, plan, act, verify
      - Side Panel chat UI for manual command entry and agent interaction
