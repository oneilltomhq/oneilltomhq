    description: >-
      Chromium shell — a Chrome extension that acts as an agentic interface
      to the browser's power tools (debugger, side panel, screen capture),
      with a 3D multiplexed terminal UI built on Three.js WebGPU, SDF text
      rendering, and libghostty-vt.
    url: https://github.com/oneilltomhq/crush
    startDate: 2026-02-08
    highlights:
      - Three.js WebGPU renderer + TSL blocks for 3D orchestration UI

      - Tabs represented as 3D terminal panes in an orchestration window
      - Q&A-driven, scientific-methodology approach — discovering boundaries empirically
      - Browser-native security model — no sysadmin or dev experience required, just install the extension
